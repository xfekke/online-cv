    <p class="description">
      My name is Sebastian and this site will work as my online CV since I am currently looking for an internship in
      January 2025 as a software tester. I am planning to add more things as I learn to show my current level of skill. 
      I am an enthusiastic and goal-oriented individual who always strives to learn something new. 
      <br/>
      I have a creative and positive attitude that reflects on my work.
      I have worked with JavaScript, MySQL, Postman, MongoDB, Cypress.io and Vitest. I have also worked in groups with SCRUM practices and agile methodologies.
        <br/>
      Iâ€™m based in Stockholm where I am studying at KYH to become a software tester. If you have an available spot as an
      intern for me
