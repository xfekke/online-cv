        <p class="description">
          My name is Sebastian, and I am currently studying software testing at KYH in Stockholm. I am looking for an internship in software testing sfor the spring semester in 2025, where I can apply my skills and enthusiasm to contribute to your team.
          <br/>
          I have experience with tools and frameworks like JavaScript, MySQL, Postman, MongoDB, Cypress.io, Selenium, Playwright, and Vitest. I have also collaborated with teams using SCRUM and agile methodologies.
          <br/>
          Outside of studies, I enjoy digital painting, listening to music, and spending time with family and friends. I am fluent in both English and Swedish, in both speech and writing.
          <br/>
          I am a curious and goal-oriented individual passionate about learning and professional growth. I look forward to connecting if you have an opportunity that matches my skills.
