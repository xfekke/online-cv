    <p class="description">
      My name is Sebastian, and this website serves as my online CV as I seek an internship in software testing starting in January 2025. I plan to continuously update this site to reflect my growing skills and experiences.
      <br/>
      I am an enthusiastic and goal-oriented individual dedicated to learning and professional development. My creative and positive attitude is evident in my work. I have experience with working in JavaScript, MySQL, Postman, MongoDB, Cypress.io, and Vitest. Additionally, I have collaborated with teams utilizing SCRUM practices and agile methodologies.
        <br/>
      I am currently studying at KYH in Stockholm, where I am training to become a software tester. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to connect if you have any internship positions available.
