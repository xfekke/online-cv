    <h3>API DB Assignment</h3>
    
    <a href="https://github.com/xfekke/api-db-assignment">Link to my project</a>
    <p>This assignment was to create an API where I chose the theme of books.
    <br>
    I created my own API, 2 databases with MongoDB where one contained all the books with 
    relevant information and one with the authors. 
    <br>
    I used  Postman to test my API with 14 manual and 14 automated tests that I 
    also attempted to create professional documentation to. In addition 
    I created a mock-server in Postman to save the results.
