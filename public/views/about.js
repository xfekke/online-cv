    <h4>
      My name is Sebastian and this site will work as my online CV since I am currently looking for an internship in
      January
      2025 as a software tester. I am planning to add more things as I learn to show my current level of skill. I am an
      enthusiastic and goal oriented individual who always strives to learn something new. I have a creative and
      positive
      attitude that reflects on my work.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have worked with JavaScript, MySQL, Postman, MongoDB, Cypress.io and Vitest. I have also worked in groups with SCRUM practices and agile methodologies.
      <br>
      <br>
      Iâ€™m based in Stockholm where I am studying at KYH to become a software tester. If you have an available spot as an
      intern for me, I can be found by clicking on any of the logos below or at:
